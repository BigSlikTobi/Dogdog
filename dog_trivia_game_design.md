# Dog Trivia Quiz Game Concept

## Game Overview
This game is a **dog‑themed trivia quiz** aimed at children roughly **8–12 years old** (though fun for all ages).  
Players answer multiple‑choice questions about dogs—breeds, traits, and fun facts.  
The **core loop** is:

1. A question with four answers appears.  
2. The player taps an answer.  
3. Immediate feedback + a short **fun fact** shows.  
4. Score/lives update, then the next question loads.

The app will be rebuilt in **Flutter** for both iOS and Android.
