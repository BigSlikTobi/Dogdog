# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DogDog Trivia Game currently has mixed English and German text throughout the application. This feature will implement proper Flutter localization (l10n) to automatically detect the user's device locale and display the app in their preferred language. The app will support German, English, and Spanish, with English as the fallback for all other locales. The system will be designed for easy addition of new languages in the future.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with a specific device locale, I want the app to automatically display in my language (German, English, or Spanish), so that I can fully understand and enjoy the game in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches AND the device locale is German THEN the system SHALL display all UI text in German
2. WHEN the app launches AND the device locale is English THEN the system SHALL display all UI text in English
3. WHEN the app launches AND the device locale is Spanish THEN the system SHALL display all UI text in Spanish
4. WHEN the app launches AND the device locale is any other language THEN the system SHALL display all UI text in English as fallback
5. WHEN the device locale changes THEN the system SHALL update the app language accordingly on next launch

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement Flutter's localization framework, so that the app can be easily extended to support multiple languages in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up localization THEN the system SHALL use Flutter's official l10n package
2. WHEN defining text strings THEN the system SHALL store them in ARB (Application Resource Bundle) files
3. WHEN accessing localized strings THEN the system SHALL use generated localization classes
4. WHEN building the app THEN the system SHALL automatically generate localization code
5. WHEN adding new text THEN the system SHALL follow the established localization pattern

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent translations in my language that are age-appropriate and culturally relevant, so that the game feels natural and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying welcome messages THEN the system SHALL use child-friendly phrases appropriate for each supported language
2. WHEN showing button labels THEN the system SHALL use clear, actionable verbs in the user's language
3. WHEN presenting game instructions THEN the system SHALL use simple vocabulary appropriate for ages 8-12 in each language
4. WHEN displaying achievement names THEN the system SHALL use culturally appropriate dog breed names and terminology for each language
5. WHEN showing error messages THEN the system SHALL use gentle, encouraging language appropriate for each locale

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace all hardcoded strings with localized versions, so that the app maintains consistency and professionalism across all supported languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the home screen THEN the system SHALL display localized text for welcome messages and descriptions
2. WHEN showing difficulty selection THEN the system SHALL use localized difficulty names and descriptions
3. WHEN displaying game UI elements THEN the system SHALL show localized labels for score, lives, and timer
4. WHEN presenting result screens THEN the system SHALL use localized feedback messages
5. WHEN showing settings and navigation THEN the system SHALL display localized menu items and options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want comprehensive localization testing, so that I can verify all text appears correctly in all supported languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running automated tests THEN the system SHALL verify localized text appears correctly in all UI components for each supported language
2. WHEN testing screen navigation THEN the system SHALL confirm text consistency across all screens for each locale
3. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL validate error messages display correctly in the appropriate language
4. WHEN testing accessibility features THEN the system SHALL ensure localized text works with screen readers for all supported languages
5. WHEN performing integration tests THEN the system SHALL verify complete localization coverage for German, English, and Spanish

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a future maintainer, I want clear documentation and structure for localization, so that I can easily add new languages or update existing translations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation for adding new locales
2. WHEN examining ARB files THEN the system SHALL include descriptive comments for each translation key
3. WHEN looking at localization usage THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
4. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL provide examples of proper localization implementation
5. WHEN maintaining translations THEN the system SHALL organize strings logically by feature or screen
