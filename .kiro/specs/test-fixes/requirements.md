# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DogDog trivia game currently has extensive test failures across multiple test suites that need to be systematically resolved to ensure CI/CD pipeline functionality and code quality. The test failures appear to stem from deeper architectural issues including missing dependencies, outdated test patterns, incorrect mock setups, and inconsistencies between test expectations and actual implementation. This specification addresses the need to fix all failing tests through a structured approach that identifies root causes, updates test infrastructure, and ensures comprehensive test coverage for continued development.

## Requirements

6. WHEN any unit test fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific issue

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all integration tests to pass reliably, so that I can verify that different components work together correctly.

6. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL complete within reasonable time limits (under 5 minutes total)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all screen and widget tests to pass consistently, so that I can ensure the UI components render and behave correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `flutter test test/screens/` THEN the system SHALL execute all screen tests without failures

4. WHEN testing widgets with animations THEN the system SHALL properly handle animation controllers and tickers
5. WHEN testing widgets with providers THEN the system SHALL correctly set up provider hierarchies and state
6. WHEN widget tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear information about rendering or interaction issues

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test infrastructure to be robust and maintainable, so that tests remain reliable as the codebase evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up tests THEN the system SHALL provide consistent test helper utilities and fixtures
2. WHEN mocking dependencies THEN the system SHALL use standardized mock implementations across all tests
3. WHEN testing async operations THEN the system SHALL properly handle futures, streams, and timers
4. WHEN testing with external dependencies THEN the system SHALL use appropriate mocking strategies
5. WHEN tests require specific setup THEN the system SHALL provide reusable setup and teardown methods
6. WHEN adding new tests THEN the system SHALL follow established patterns and conventions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage reporting, so that I can identify untested code paths and ensure quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `flutter test --coverage` THEN the system SHALL generate accurate coverage reports
2. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN the system SHALL show line, function, and branch coverage metrics
3. WHEN coverage is below acceptable thresholds THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which files need additional testing
4. WHEN viewing coverage reports THEN the system SHALL exclude generated files and test files from coverage calculations
5. WHEN coverage reports are created THEN the system SHALL be compatible with CI/CD pipeline reporting tools
6. WHEN coverage analysis runs THEN the system SHALL complete without errors or missing file references

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to run efficiently in CI/CD pipelines, so that automated testing doesn't become a bottleneck in the development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run in CI/CD THEN the system SHALL complete all tests within 10 minutes maximum
2. WHEN running tests in parallel THEN the system SHALL not have race conditions or shared state issues
3. WHEN tests fail in CI/CD THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages and logs
4. WHEN CI/CD runs tests THEN the system SHALL properly handle platform-specific dependencies and configurations
5. WHEN test results are reported THEN the system SHALL provide structured output compatible with CI/CD reporting
6. WHEN tests are flaky THEN the system SHALL identify and resolve sources of non-deterministic behavior

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want accessibility and responsive design tests to pass, so that the app meets quality standards for all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running accessibility tests THEN the system SHALL verify proper semantic labels and screen reader support
2. WHEN testing responsive design THEN the system SHALL validate layouts across different screen sizes
3. WHEN accessibility tests execute THEN the system SHALL check contrast ratios and touch target sizes
4. WHEN responsive tests run THEN the system SHALL verify proper widget scaling and overflow handling
5. WHEN accessibility features are tested THEN the system SHALL ensure keyboard navigation and focus management work correctly
6. WHEN responsive design tests complete THEN the system SHALL validate that all UI elements remain usable across device sizes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want localization tests to pass consistently, so that the app works correctly in all supported languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running localization tests THEN the system SHALL verify all supported languages (English, German, Spanish) load correctly
2. WHEN testing localized content THEN the system SHALL ensure all text keys have corresponding translations
3. WHEN localization tests execute THEN the system SHALL validate proper text formatting and layout in different languages
4. WHEN testing language switching THEN the system SHALL verify that UI updates correctly without requiring app restart
5. WHEN localization tests run THEN the system SHALL check for missing translations and placeholder text
6. WHEN testing localized content THEN the system SHALL ensure proper handling of text direction and cultural formatting

### Requirement 9
