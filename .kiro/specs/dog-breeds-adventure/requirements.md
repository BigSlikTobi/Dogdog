# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Dog Breeds Adventure is a picture-based identification game where players must
correctly identify dog breeds by selecting the correct image from two options.

featuring progressive difficulty scaling, localized breed names, power-ups, and
time-based challenges to create an engaging educational experience.
