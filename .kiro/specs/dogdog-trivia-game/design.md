```

### Application Structure

The application follows a layered architecture pattern:

- **Presentation Layer**: Flutter widgets and screens
- **Business Logic Layer**: Game controllers and state management
- **Data Layer**: Models, repositories, and local storage
- **Services Layer**: Audio, animations, and utility services

### State Management

The application uses Provider pattern for state management to handle:
- Game state (current question, score, lives, level)
- Player progress (achievements, unlocked content)
- Settings and preferences
- Power-up inventory

}
```

### Enums

```dart
enum Difficulty { easy, medium, hard, expert }
enum PowerUpType { fiftyFifty, hint, extraTime, skip, secondChance }
enum Rank { chihuahua, pug, cockerSpaniel, germanShepherd, greatDane }
enum GameResult { win, lose, quit }
```
