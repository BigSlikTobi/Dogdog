about: GameController tests have 6 failing edge cases out of 40 total tests
title: '[BUG] GameController tests failing on edge cases (6/40 failing)'
labels: 'bug, testing, game-logic'
assignees: 'BigSlikTobi'

**Describe the bug**
The GameController test suite has 6 failing tests out of 40 total tests (85% success rate). The failing tests appear to be related to edge cases in game state management, exception handling, and statistics calculation.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Run `flutter test test/controllers/game_controller_test.dart --reporter=expanded`
2. Observe 6 test failures out of 40 total tests
3. Check the specific failing test cases (names not fully captured in last run)

**Expected behavior**
All 40 GameController tests should pass, ensuring robust game state management including:
- Proper exception handling in async operations
- Correct statistics calculation in edge cases
- Reliable game state transitions
- Proper cleanup and reset functionality

**Screenshots**
Test output showing partial failure:
```
00:00 +40 -6: Some tests failed.
flutter test test/controllers/game_controller_test.dart --reporter=expanded
34/40 tests passing (85% success rate)
```

**Device information:**
- Environment: Test suite (all platforms affected)
- Flutter SDK: 3.32.0  
- Test Framework: Flutter Test
- Component: GameController business logic

**Additional context**
The GameController is a critical component that manages:
- Game session state and flow
- Question progression and scoring
- Power-up activation and management
- Statistics tracking and calculation
- Achievement progress tracking

Having 15% test failures in this core component could indicate potential runtime issues, though the main game functionality appears to work correctly.

**Logs**
Most recent test run showed:
```
00:00 +40 -6: Some tests failed.
Command exited with code 1
```

**Investigation needed**
To properly fix these tests, we need to:
1. Run the GameController tests with detailed output to identify specific failing test cases
2. Analyze whether failures are due to:
   - Incorrect test expectations
   - Actual bugs in game logic
   - Race conditions in async operations
   - Missing error handling
   - Statistics calculation errors

**Proposed Solutions**
1. Re-run tests with verbose output to identify specific failures
2. Review and fix any actual game logic bugs discovered
3. Update test expectations if they're based on incorrect assumptions
4. Add better error handling for edge cases if needed
5. Ensure proper async/await handling in game controller methods
6. Verify statistics calculations match expected business rules
