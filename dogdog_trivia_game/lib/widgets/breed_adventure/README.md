└── Critical Time: For ≤1 second remaining
```

**Audio and Haptic Feedback:**
- Timer warning sounds at 3 seconds
- Haptic feedback for critical moments
- Screen reader announcements for time updates

## Technical Implementation

### High Contrast Support

All widgets automatically detect and adapt to system high contrast mode:

```dart
final isHighContrast = AccessibilityUtils.isHighContrastEnabled(context);
final colorScheme = AccessibilityUtils.getHighContrastColors(context);

// Apply high contrast styling
decoration: isHighContrast 
  ? AccessibilityUtils.getAccessibleCardDecoration(context)
  : standardDecoration,
```

### Screen Reader Integration

Comprehensive semantic labeling using Flutter's Semantics widget:

```dart
Semantics(
  label: AccessibilityUtils.createGameElementLabel(
    element: AppLocalizations.of(context).breedAdventure_breedChallenge,
    value: localizedBreedName,
    context: questionText,
  ),
  hint: AppLocalizations.of(context).breedAdventure_selectCorrectImageHint,
  readOnly: true,
  child: widget,
)
```

### Keyboard Navigation

Focus management with keyboard event handling:

```dart
FocusableGameElement(
  semanticLabel: semanticLabel,
  onTap: widget.isEnabled ? () => _handleImageSelection(index) : null,
  child: widget,
)
```

### Audio and Haptic Feedback

Integrated feedback system:

```dart
void _handleImageSelection(int index) async {
  // Provide haptic feedback
  AccessibilityEnhancements.provideHapticFeedback(GameHapticType.button);
  
  // Play audio feedback
  await AudioService().playButtonSound();
  
  // Announce selection to screen reader
  AccessibilityUtils.announceToScreenReader(context, announcement);
  
  // Call original callback
  widget.onImageSelected(index);
}
```

### Reduced Motion Support

Automatic detection and adaptation:

```dart
AccessibilityEnhancements.buildReducedMotionWrapper(
  child: animatedWidget,
  reducedMotionChild: staticWidget,
)
```

## Localization Support

### Supported Languages
- **English (en)**: Primary language with complete coverage
- **German (de)**: Full translation including breed names
- **Spanish (es)**: Complete UI translation

### Key Localized Elements
- Question prompts and instructions
- Semantic labels for screen readers
- Time-related announcements
- Feedback messages
- Error states and recovery options

### Breed Name Localization
Comprehensive breed name translations with fallback:

```dart
final localizedBreedName = BreedLocalizationService.getLocalizedBreedName(
  context,
  widget.breedName,
);
```

## Testing Coverage

### Automated Tests
- Semantic label verification
- High contrast mode rendering
- Keyboard navigation functionality
- Large text scaling support
- Localization accuracy
- Touch target size compliance

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Screen reader navigation (VoiceOver/TalkBack)
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation
- [ ] High contrast mode visual verification
- [ ] Large text scaling (200%+)
- [ ] Audio feedback functionality
- [ ] Haptic feedback on supported devices
- [ ] Reduced motion preference respect
- [ ] Multi-language functionality

## Performance Considerations

### Accessibility Performance
- Semantic labels are computed efficiently
- High contrast detection is cached
- Audio services use lazy loading
- Haptic feedback is throttled appropriately

### Memory Management
- Proper disposal of animation controllers
- Efficient focus node management
- Audio service resource cleanup

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Always provide meaningful semantic labels
2. Test with actual screen readers
3. Verify keyboard navigation paths
4. Check high contrast mode appearance
5. Test with large text scaling
6. Validate audio feedback timing
7. Ensure proper focus management

### For Content
1. Use clear, descriptive labels
2. Provide context for interactive elements
3. Include helpful hints for complex interactions
4. Maintain consistent terminology
5. Test translations with native speakers

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Voice control integration
- Enhanced gesture support
- Customizable audio cues
- Advanced haptic patterns
- Additional language support
- Improved breed name pronunciation

### Accessibility Roadmap
- WCAG 2.2 compliance verification
- Advanced screen reader features
- Custom accessibility shortcuts
- Enhanced visual indicators
- Improved error recovery flows
